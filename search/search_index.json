This should include only the basic git commands (pull, push, branch, config, ...) that any user could use on their everyday use. There is room also to include \"experimental\" features (fetch commit data, fetch specific commit). DB Manager Python, SQL Alchemy An GUI that allows accessing and modifying (add/remove entries) through SQL commands. These commands should be hidden for the user. 8-bit Chip (rename) Rust Basic emulation of an 8-bit chipset (old GameBoy generation) coded with Rust. This project provides a lot of understanding about use of registers and memory. Password Manager Rust A password manager that stores and generates passwords to log into accounts. All the passwords should be stored locally in an encrypted file. Board puzzle generator Python Algorithms to generate puzzles at any chess-like board. The puzzles to support should be 'Sudoku', 'Binario', 'Queens', 'Nonograms' and 'Connecting pipes'. Rusty logger Rust A multi-threaded .log parser and analyzer to be used only as a CLI tool. It could support multiple log formats (through config file), allow users to search patterns and produce new reports. QR Generator Rust A simple QR generator trying to use as least 3rd-parties packages as possible. The QR could be exported as SVG or PNG. <p>Note</p> <p>This table is coded as a basic Markdown table, without any sorting nor filtering.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pybackport/","title":"PyBackport: Backporting from newer Python releases","text":"GitHub RepoMain LanguageStatus PyBackport Maintained <p>The goal of <code>PyBackport</code> is to enable the use of new classes and functionalities from newer into older python releases. While the use of newer python releases is always recommended, there are software releases which constrains are to support old python releases.

I knew about <code>StrEnums</code> and how they could be beneficial for these projects, but they are supported only at Python 3.11.</p> <p>Due to this limitation, I was looking for a small solution without using <code>aenum</code>. So I coded a small package (without further requirements) which backports some functionalities to previous Python releases.</p> <p>I coded some backports for both modules <code>enum</code> and <code>bultins</code> (only <code>str</code> and <code>dict</code>).
