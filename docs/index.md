# Welcome to my website!

Hey, I'm Jaime Gonzalez, **@Jtachan** on GitHub and other platforms.

I develop Python (primary language) and Rust (secondary language) tools and libraries.
Everything you can find here is open-source, where I explain the full process for anyone to be able to understand and recreate the projects.

## Project index table

There is a table of all the projects I have worked on at the past.
Some of them are fully finished (without further scope of increasing the project), while others I still maintain or are on-going projects.

!!! tip
    If there is any icon you don't recognize, place the mouse cursor on top of it, and it will display the name of the language or framework.

<div id="project-table"></div>

!!! Note
    All projects are currently organized by creation date (newer first).
    I am working on sorting options not for only creation date, but also to display the ones with the last commits first.
