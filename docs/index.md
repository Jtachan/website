# Welcome to my website!

Hey, I'm Jaime Gonzalez, **@Jtachan** on GitHub and other platforms.

I develop Python (primary language) and Rust (secondary language) tools and libraries.
Everything you can find here is open-source, where I explain the full process for anyone to be able to understand and recreate the projects.

## Project index table

Here you can see a table where I organize my projects (finished, on-going and not started).
This is mostly an organizing tool for me, but you can use it to jump directly to those projects document or repository.

!!! tip
    If there is any icon you don't recognize, place the mouse cursor on top of it and it will display the name of the language or framework.
