# Welcome to my website!

Hey, I'm Jaime Gonzalez, **@Jtachan** on GitHub and other platforms.
I work as an algorithm engineer, but on my free time I develop OpenSource code to explore new challenges and keep learning.

I develop Python (primary language) and Rust (secondary language) tools and libraries.
Everything you can find here is OpenSource, where I explain the full process for anyone to be able to understand and recreate the projects.

[//]: # (These are the last 5 personal projects where I have commited and pushed changes &#40;not considering this website&#41;.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (| Name | Main Language | Description | Last commit &#40;YYYY.MM.DD&#41; |)

[//]: # (| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |)

[//]: # ({% for item in items[:5] -%})

[//]: # (| {{ item.name }} | {{ item.lang[0] }} | {{ item.descr }} | {{ item.last_commit }} |)

[//]: # ({% endfor %})

!!! tip
    If there is any icon you don't recognize, place the mouse cursor on top of it, and it will display the name of the language or framework.

!!! Note
    All projects are currently organized by creation date (newer first).
    I am working on sorting options not for only creation date, but also to display the ones with the last commits first.
