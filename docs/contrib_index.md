# Open Source Contributions

At this section you will find Open Source projects that I have not created, but I have contributed to.

I find important to clarify that these are contributions where I took the role of owner/maintainer or where some substantial pull request (that I pushed) was merged.
For those cases, you will be able to find at the reports how my contribution was of help and the explanation of the algorithms that I worked on.
