This project wasn't my first project where I needed to create an HTML with simple CSS, 
but it was my first project where I chose to code in JavaScript.

My plan was to create a JSON database to be displayed at an HTML.
For that purpose, I took the strategy to ask AI to teach me one by one all the requirements I was looking for.
With that purpose, I created a table that allows:

- Selecting a specific version among two databases.
- Apply filters over the displayed data.
- Allow searching by name in real time.
- Selection of the units either in imperial or in the metric system.
- Present a simple UI, allowing to click over an item to display a new window with all expanded information.
- Not collect any information whatsoever from whomever uses it.

## Motivation

We all have our hobbies. One of mine is to play DnD (_Dungeons and Dragons_).
However, I was not able to find a free and fast tool that would allow players to quickly search DnD spells in real time.
There are many software tools, but they are either not fast, not free, loaded with adds or not in Spanish (my mother tongue).

For that purpose, and with the new apparition at the time of the LLMs like Chat GPT, Claude, and Gemini;
I planned how to organize the database for later on ask AI to allow extracting data for me.
