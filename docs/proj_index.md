# My Projects

Here you will find relevant information about all my projects.
You can search any project either:

- Using the left TOC, where all reports are sorted by the main used coding language.
- By using the table, where you can apply filters or sort by columns. Click directly on the row of the project to jump to the report.

<div id="project-table"></div>

!!! tip
    If there is any icon you don't recognize, place the mouse cursor on top of it, and it will display the name of the language or framework.

## About each project report

Within each project, the fist thing you will encounter is a table like this:

| GitHub Repo | Main Language | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GH Repo link | Python, Rust, Js, etc | <span style="color: blue">Maintained</span> / <span style="color: green">Finished</span> / <span style="color: red">Ongoing</span> |

Where the status indicates:

<ul>
    <li><b><span style="color: blue">Maintained</span></b>: The project is at a finished/released status, but I am still releasing new features or fixes if required.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: green">Finished</span></b>: The project is finished, and it should not expect new pushes.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: red">Ongoing</span></b>: The project is unfinished. It's project documentation page will show basic info about it and a stage where the project lies at the moment</li>
</ul>

## Further project ideas

You can find some of my ideas for new projects at [_Next Up_ projects](projects/nextup.md).
They are more of a help for me, a place where I can write my ideas of projects I would like to work on for fun or to learn new technologies/abilities.
