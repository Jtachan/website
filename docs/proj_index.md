# My Projects

Here you will find relevant information about all my projects.
At the ToC at the left I have organized all projects regarding the main language they are coded in.

As an **algorithm engineer**, my main goal is always to _understand_ the logic of anything.
My second next goal is to be able to explain it so a kid can also understand the basic idea.
Only when someone control those two goals, that person can say the know how something works, and they could replicate or even improve it.

That is the main reason for each project in this website to present a document where the logic is explained.
You might not see the code (although I will provide access to it), but you will read how things work.

Within each project, the fist thing you will encounter is a table like this:

| GitHub Repo | Main Language | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GH Repo link | Python, Rust, Js, etc | <span style="color: blue">Maintained</span> / <span style="color: green">Finished</span> / <span style="color: red">Ongoing</span> |

Where the status indicates:

<ul>
    <li><b><span style="color: blue">Maintained</span></b>: The project is at a finished/released status, but I am still releasing new features or fixes if required.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: green">Finished</span></b>: The project is finished, and it should not expect new pushes.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: red">Ongoing</span></b>: The project is unfinished. It's project documentation page will show basic info about it and a stage where the project lies at the moment</li>
</ul>

At last, you will also find my [_Next Up_ projects](projects/nextup.md).
They are more of a help for me, a place where I can write my ideas of projects I would like to work on for fun or to learn new technologies/abilities.
